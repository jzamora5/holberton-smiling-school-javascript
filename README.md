# Holberton Smiling School (Bootstrap Project)

These group of web pages were coded from scratch with the help of the Boostrap Framework and based on some design models given on Figma.

The dynamic generated content was created with the help of jQUERY and JavaScript.

# Challenges and Future Features

This was an interesting project that measure knowledge in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery.

It was challenging because it was born from a Figma design withot specific rules of development.

In the future it would be interesting to change JQuery for React or another more robust JS Framework.
